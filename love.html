    <h2>my love 💕 stealing your heart was the perfect crime</h2>
    <p>Being with you in my heart 💜 is a favourite feeling.</p>
    <p>You make my heart smile 😊.</p>
    <p>did you know i have the best partiner ever 😘.</p>
    <p>some say a picture is worth a thousand words.</p>
    <p>I never believed the words in love songs untill i met you.</p>
    <p>Now i see 🙈 it's really 💓.</p>
    <p>your voice is my favorite sound.</p>
    <p>So far, every moment we've spent together has been awesome. But I promise you, that the best is yet to come.</p>
    <p>If only you knew how much those little moments with you matter to me.</p>
    <p>You have no idea how much my heart races when I see you.</p>
    <p>I never want to dream of leaving.</p>
    <p>Somehow just hearing your name gives me butterflies.</p>
    <p>What on earth did I think about all the time before you?.</p>
    <p>If you were a movie, I'd watch you over and over again.</p>

    <p>If loving you was a job, I'd be the most deserving, dedicated, and qualified candidate. In fact, I'd even be willing to work for free!</p>
    <p>How lucky am I to have fallen in love with you?</p>
    <p>Do you have any idea how much I miss you every second of the day that we're not together?</p>
    <p>Your smile is literally the cutest thing I've ever seen in my life.</p>
    <p>If someone asked me to describe you in just two words, I'd say "Simply Amazing."</p>
    <p>You do a million little things that bring joy to my life.</p>
    <p>If I could give you one thing in life, I'd give you the ability to see yourself through my eyes. Only then would you realize how special you are to me.</p>
    <p>I know fairy tales come true because I have you.</p>

    <p>There are only two times that I want to be with you: Now and Forever.</p>
    <p>My six-word love story: "I can't imagine life without you."</p>
    <p>You are my soulmate, my best friend—what would I do without you?</p>
    <p>You add a breath of fresh air and a ray of sunshine to this day-to-day routine we call life.</p>
    <p>I want to be the reason behind your beautiful smile today and every day.</p>
    <p>Thank you for always making me feel like the most beautiful woman in the world 💅💄👑👄</p>
    <p>Next time I have a chance to hug you, I probably won't let go for a long time.</p>
    <p>I can't decide if the best part of my day is waking up next to you, or going to sleep with you. Hurry home so I can compare the two again.</p>
    <p>Everyone has their own motivation to get up in the morning and face the day. You are mine.</p>
    <p>Whenever my phone vibrates, I hope you're the reason for it.</p>
    <p> Iove you Dammie ❤️ ,with all my heart.</p>
